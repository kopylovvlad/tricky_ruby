# Tricky Ruby notebook

Hello. It's a repository with my notes about not obvious things in Ruby and RoR. Some of them can be dangerous, interesting or can produce side-effect in your code.

Also there are some my notes about Postgresql, software design and terminal tricks. You can read it and enjoy.
