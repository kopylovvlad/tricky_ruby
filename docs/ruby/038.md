# Flexible method params

In Ruby we can create a method with flexibles params, such as FactoryBot's method `build`. It's good example because it receives 3 params: factory name, traits and options, but we don't have to assign them all.

```ruby
# Just build a factory
FactoryBot.build(:website)
# with options
FactoryBot.build(:website, domain: 'rubyapi.org')
# with one trait
FactoryBot.build(:website, :google)
# with one trait and options
FactoryBot.build(:website, :google, description: "It's google")
# with traits
FactoryBot.build(:website, :google, :with_log_description)
# with traits and options
FactoryBot.build(:website, :google, :with_log_description, domain: 'google.it')
```

How to implement a methid like that? In order to do it, we have to use `Array#extract_options!` method from `ActiveSupport`.

```ruby
class Array
  def extract_options!
    last.is_a?(::Hash) ? pop : {}
  end
end
```

It helps us to implement `build` method which receives traits and options and doesn't mix them.

```ruby
module FactoryBot
  # @param factory_name [Symbol]
  # @param traits_and_opts [Array]
  def self.build(factory_name, *traits_and_opts)
    opts = traits_and_opts.extract_options!
    traits = traits_and_opts
    puts "Factory_name: #{factory_name}"
    puts "Traits: #{traits}"
    puts "Options: #{opts}\n\r"
  end
end
```
