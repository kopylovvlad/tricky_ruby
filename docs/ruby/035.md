# How to pass variables to ERB-template

I was curious about how does `render` function work in Rails and pass variables from `locals` argument to a view

```ruby
render partial: "product", locals: { product: product }
```

It can work without running `exec` function. It's enough to call `local_variable_set` method on `Binding` object.

```ruby
# @param view_path [String]
# @param locals [Hash<Symbol, Object>]
def render_view(view_path, locals: {})
  # 1: create an execution context
  local_binding = binding
  locals.each do |key, value|
    # 2: assign data from locals as local variables to the context
    local_binding.local_variable_set(key, value)
  end
  # 3: Execute the ERB code and pass local context with variables
  ERB.new(view_path).result(local_binding)
end
```

We can run the function as

```ruby
render_view('product.html.erb', locals: { product: Product.new })
```
