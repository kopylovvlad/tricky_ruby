# How to exec a ruby script faster

If you have a single file Ruby script and don't use any gems, you can make the running faster to run script with `--disable-gems` flag.

```bash
$ cat script.rb
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts "Hello Ruby!"

$ time ./script.rb
Hello Ruby!
./script.rb  0.13s user 0.05s system 74% cpu 0.244 total
```

You can easily add `#!/usr/bin/env ruby --disable-gems` to the first line and it speeds up the boost time

```bash
$ cat script.rb
#!/usr/bin/env ruby --disable-gems
puts "Hello Ruby!"

$ time ./script.rb
Hello Ruby!
./script.rb  0.02s user 0.01s system 69% cpu 0.049 total
```

How does it work. The theory is RubyGems does lots of IO at startup, and IO operation are slow operations.
