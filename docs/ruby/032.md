# Ways to monkey patch

## To monkey patch with prepend

One way to do it easily and elegant is to create a module and to extend the module using [prepend](https://rubyapi.org/3.1/o/module#method-i-prepend) method.

```ruby
module SomeClassPatch
  def public_method
    # code
  end

  private

  def private_method
    # code
  end
end

SomeClass.send(:prepend, SomeClassPatch)
```

Advantages: the module with patch is added before the class in the ancestor chain. You can see it by running [ancestors](https://rubyapi.org/3.1/o/module#method-i-ancestors) method.

```ruby
SomeClass.ancestors

# SomeClassPatch
# SomeClass
# Object
# Kernel
# BasicObject
```

Disadvantages: the class is patched globally. Sometimes it isn't good solution.

## To monkey patch with refine

For temporary patching you can use [refine](https://rubyapi.org/3.1/o/module#method-i-refine).

```ruby
require 'delegate'

# Create a module with a patch
module MyPatch
  refine Hash do
    def all_keys
      keys.join(',')
    end
  end
end

# Create a decorator with patch
class HashDecorator < SimpleDelegator
  # using the module with patch
  # below the code we can write a method which can use the patch
  using MyPatch

  def all_keys
    __getobj__.all_keys
  end
end

# A hash object
hash = {key1: '1', key2: '2'}
decorated_hash = HashDecorator.new(hash)

# With the decorator we are able to use .all_keys method
puts decorated_hash.all_keys
# key1,key2

# outside the decorator method .all_keys doesn't exist
puts decorated_hash.__getobj__.all_keys
puts hash.all_keys
#  undefined method `all_keys' for {:key1=>"1", :key2=>"2"}:Hash (NoMethodError)
```
