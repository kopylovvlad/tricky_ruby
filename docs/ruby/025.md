# Open the source code

## Open core libs source code

For example, you use Ruby-3.0.1 and you want to open source code of net/http.rb. All core libs are located in `~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-3.0.1/lib/ruby/3.0.0/`. So, you can open it by `open ~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-3.0.1/lib/ruby/3.0.0/net/http.rb`

## Open gem source

To see location for a gem use `bundle show` or `bundle info`

```bash
bundle show bundler-audit
# /Users/myuser/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.7.3/gems/bundler-audit-0.8.0

bundle info bundler-audit
# * bundler-audit (0.8.0)
# Summary: Patch-level verification for Bundler
# Homepage: https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit#readme
# Path: /Users/myuser/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.7.3/gems/bundler-audit-0.8.0
```

To open the gem code use `bundle open`. Maybe you need to set $EDITOR variable.

```bash
bundle open bundler-audit
# or
EDITOR=vim bundle open bundler-audit
```
