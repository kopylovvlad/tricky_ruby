# Flip Flop Operator

Ruby has the flip flop operator `..` for conditions.

```ruby
(1..10).each do |x|
  puts x if (x == 5) .. (x == 7)
end
# 5
# 6
# 7
```

The condition evaluates to false every time it is evaluated until the first part evaluates to true. Then it evaluates to true until the second part evaluates to true. In the above example, the flip-flop is turned on when x == 5 and stays on until x == 7, so the numbers from 5 to 7 are printed.

One more example below to understand the logic.

```ruby
[4, 5, 5.1, 5.2, 6, 6.1, 7, 8].each do |x|
  puts x if (x == 5) .. (x == 7)
end
# 5
# 5.1
# 5.2
# 6
# 6.1
# 7
```

The flip flop operator only works inside ifs and ternary conditions. Everywhere else, Ruby considers it to be the range operator.
