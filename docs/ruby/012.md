# Variable and fuction names

In Ruby you can create variable with the same name as a method. Be careful!

```ruby
class Foo
  def initialize
    @counter = 0
  end

  def call1
    @counter = bar # bar is a funtion
    @counter # counter eqials 13
  end

  def call2
    bar = 22 # bar is a variable
    @counter = bar # assign 22 to counter
    @counter # counter equals 22
  end

  def call3
    bar = 22 # bar is a variable
    @counter = bar() # assign 13 to counter, because bar() is a function
    @counter # counter equals 13
  end

  private

  def bar
    12 + 1
  end
end

puts Foo.new.call1
# 13
puts Foo.new.call2
# 22
puts Foo.new.call3
# 13
```
