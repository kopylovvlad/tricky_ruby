# How to add completion for a bash script


1 - you have a script `dothis`

```bash
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "No command number passed"
  exit 2
fi

exists=$(fc -l -1000 | grep ^$1 -- 2>/dev/null)

if [ -n "$exists" ]; then
  fc -s -- "$1"
else
  echo "Command with number $1 was not found in recent history"
  exit 2
fi
```

2 - In order to write completion create a file `dothis-completion.bash`

```bash
#/usr/bin/env bash

complete -W "now1 tomorrow1 never1" dothis
```

3 - In order to add completion to your current bash session run

```bash
source ./dothis-completion.bash
```

4 - Voil√†! Now you can push <tab> and see complection
