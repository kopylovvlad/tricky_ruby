# Find records missing an association with `where.missing`

In rails 6.1 you can find all records missing an association without `left_joins`

```ruby
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :recovery_email_addresses
end

# Before Rails 6.1
Account.left_joins(:recovery_email_addresses).where(recovery_email_addresses: { id: nil })

# After Rails 6.1
Account.where.missing(:recovery_email_addresses)
```

There is also rubocop rule for that [Rails/WhereMissing](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop-rails/cops_rails.html#railswheremissing)
