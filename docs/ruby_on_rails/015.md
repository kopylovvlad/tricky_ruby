# preload vs includes

### Joins

```ruby
User.joins(:posts).where(posts: { active: true })
```

* uses inner join
* does not load associated records in memory.
* executes single query
* it does not solve n+1 problem

### Preload

```ruby
User.preload(:posts)
```

* does not perform join
* load associated data in memory.
* executes multiple queries
* it solves n+1 problem

### Includes

```ruby
User.includes(:posts)

User.includes(:posts).references(:posts)
```

* perform left outer join and store associated data in the memory.
* Sometimes generate one query and sometimes generates 2 queries
* If you want to force to use a single query you can add references
* it solves n+1 problem

### Eager load

```ruby
User.eager_load(:posts).where("posts.visible = ?", true)
```

* Load associated data in memory
* Performs LEFT OUTER join
* Forces to use a single query
* Some times takes more time than two queries
* it solves n+1 problem
