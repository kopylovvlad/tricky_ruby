# .clone, .dup, .deep_dup can't do deep clone

Methods .clone, .dup, .deep_dup can't do deep clone for objects and Hash.

```ruby
# we have data
StructObject = Struct.new(:value, :nested_object)
obj = StructObject.new(1, StructObject.new(2))


# check object_id
obj.clone.object_id == obj.object_id
# false
obj.clone.value.object_id == obj.value.object_id
# true
obj.clone.nested_object.object_id == obj.nested_object.object_id
# true


# and we can easily change original object :-(
obj.clone.nested_object.value = 33
obj.nested_object
# <struct StructObject value=33, nested_object=nil>
```

Solution: use Hash and .deep_clone. But it works only in Ruby in Rails

```ruby
obj = { value: 1, nested_object: {value: 2, nested_object: nil } }

obj.deep_dup.object_id == obj.object_id
# false
obj.deep_dup[:value].object_id == obj[:value].object_id
# true
obj.deep_dup[:nested_object].object_id == obj[:nested_object].object_id
# false

obj[:nested_object]
# {:value=>2, :nested_object=>nil}
obj.deep_dup[:nested_object][:value] = 44
obj[:nested_object]
# {:value=>2, :nested_object=>nil}
```
