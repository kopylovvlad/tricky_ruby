# Strong and soft ETag in Rails

In rails you can cache data by HTTP. We can do it by Weak ETags.

```ruby
def index
  @posts = Post.all
  fresh_when(@posts)
end

# or

def index
  @posts = Post.all
  if stale?(@posts)
    render json: @posts
  end
end
```

In order to use it, you have to send two requests. First

```
$ curl -I http://localhost:3000/posts
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: W/"a2b68b7a7f8c67f1b88848651a86f5f5"
```

And second with If-None-Match header

```
$ curl -I -H 'If-None-Match: W/"a2b68b7a7f8c67f1b88848651a86f5f5"' http://localhost:3000/posts

HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
ETag: W/"a2b68b7a7f8c67f1b88848651a86f5f5"
```

There is also Strong ETags

- Strong ETag indicates that resource content is same for response body and the response headers.
- Weak ETag indicates that the two representations are semantically equivalent. It compares only the response body.

In order to use strong ETags, write

```ruby
def index
  @posts = Post.all
  fresh_when(strong_etag: @posts)
end
```
