# LIKE and ILIKE

Use `LIKE` to select data if the string is contained in the set of strings represented by pattern. `ILIKE` is equal to `LIKE` but it's case insensitive.

An underscore (_) in pattern stands for (matches) any single character; a percent sign (%) matches any string of zero or more characters.

```
'abc' LIKE 'abc'    true
'abc' LIKE 'a%'     true
'abc' LIKE '_b_'    true
'abc' LIKE 'c'      false
```
