# Group by and having

`GROUP BY` is used to group rows by any condition. `HAVING` is used to clause specifies a search condition for a group or an aggregate.


First example. There are events table with information about venues. We can to group event by each venue.

```sql
SELECT venue_id, count(*)
  FROM events
  GROUP BY venue_id;
```

We can to select venues that have 2 or more events.

```sql
SELECT venue_id
  FROM events
  GROUP BY venue_id
  HAVING count(*) >= 2 AND venue_id IS NOT NULL;
```

Another examples

```sql
-- select author with more than 2 books

SELECT author_id
  FROM books
  GROUP BY author_id
  HAVING count(*) >  2 AND author_id IS NOT NULL;

-- select orders with sum more than $100
SELECT date(created_at) as ordered_date, sum(price) as total_price
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY date(created_at)
  HAVING sum(price) > 100

-- select topics with 4 URLs
SELECT *
  FROM topics
  INNER JOIN INNER JOIN urls ON urls.topic_id = topics.id
  GROUP BY topics.id
  HAVING count(urls.id) = 4
```
