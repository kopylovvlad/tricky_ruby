# How to join a part of table

Let's start. We have a table with users.

```sql
select * from users;
 u_name | u_region_id
--------+-------------
 Bilal  |           1
 Irfan  |           2
 Jordan |           3
 Justin |           1
 Paul   |           3
(5 rows)
```

And we create another table with job positions. Here we will store data about all past and present job position for each user.

```sql
create table job_positions(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, u_name text, position text);

insert into job_positions(u_name, position) values('Bilal', 'junion');
insert into job_positions(u_name, position) values('Bilal', 'middle');
insert into job_positions(u_name, position) values('Bilal', 'senior');

insert into job_positions(u_name, position) values('Irfan', 'junion');
insert into job_positions(u_name, position) values('Irfan', 'middle');

insert into job_positions(u_name, position) values('Jordan', 'junion');

insert into job_positions(u_name, position) values('Justin', 'intern');
```

Let's try to select data and print out the list of users and they current job postision.

```sql
-- we can use subqueries by it must return only one row
select users.u_name,
      (select position from job_positions where job_positions.u_name = users.u_name) as position
  from users;
-- ERROR: more than one row returned by a subquery used as an expression

-- To fix it we can add order by and limit
select users.u_name,
      (select position
        from job_positions
        where job_positions.u_name = users.u_name
        order by id desc
        limit 1 ) as position
  from users;

-- It returns the right answer
--------+-------------
 Bilal  | senior
 Irfan  | middle
 Jordan | junior
 Justin | intern
 Paul   | nil
```

How to replace subquery by join? Firstly, we can select the data from job_positions table with 1 row for each user. It's just a simple aggreration. Let's print out the data from job_positions table with order by id and print a row number for each user.

```sql
select id, u_name, position, row_number() over(partition by u_name order by id desc) as rn
from job_positions;

 id | u_name | position | rn
----+--------+----------+----
  3 | Bilal  | senior   |  1
  2 | Bilal  | middle   |  2
  1 | Bilal  | junion   |  3
  5 | Irfan  | middle   |  1
  4 | Irfan  | junion   |  2
  6 | Jordan | junion   |  1
  7 | Justin | intern   |  1
(7 rows)

```

Next, let's write an aggregation to choose only rows where row number is equal 1.

```sql
select id, u_name, position
from
  (select id, u_name, position, row_number() over(partition by u_name order by id desc) as rn
     from job_positions) as t
where rn = 1;

 id | u_name | position
----+--------+----------
  3 | Bilal  | senior
  5 | Irfan  | middle
  6 | Jordan | junion
  7 | Justin | intern
(4 rows)
```

The result of the query we can join.

```sql
select users.u_name, job_positions.position as position
from users
left join
  (select id, u_name, position
    from
    (select id, u_name, position, row_number() over(partition by u_name order by id desc) as rn
      from job_positions) as t
      where rn = 1) as job_positions
on job_positions.u_name = users.u_name;

-- It returns right answer
--------+-------------
 Bilal  | senior
 Irfan  | middle
 Jordan | junior
 Justin | intern
 Paul   | nil
```


Let's look at explain plan.

```sql
explain
  select users.u_name,
    (select position
      from job_positions
      where job_positions.u_name = users.u_name
      order by id desc
      limit 1 ) as position
  from users;
                                                   QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..20176.01 rows=1270 width=64)
   SubPlan 1
     ->  Limit  (cost=0.15..15.87 rows=1 width=36)
           ->  Index Scan Backward using job_positions_pkey on job_positions  (cost=0.15..63.02 rows=4 width=36)
                 Filter: (u_name = users.u_name)
(5 rows)


explain select users.u_name, job_positions.position as position
        from users
        left join
          (select id, u_name, position
            from
            (select id, u_name, position, row_number() over(partition by u_name order by id desc) as rn
              from job_positions) as t
              where rn = 1) as job_positions
        on job_positions.u_name = users.u_name;
                                          QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Left Join  (cost=87.53..115.25 rows=1270 width=64)
   Hash Cond: (users.u_name = t.u_name)
   ->  Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..22.70 rows=1270 width=32)
   ->  Hash  (cost=87.48..87.48 rows=4 width=64)
         ->  Subquery Scan on t  (cost=59.86..87.48 rows=4 width=64)
               Filter: (t.rn = 1)
               ->  WindowAgg  (cost=59.86..76.86 rows=850 width=76)
                     ->  Sort  (cost=59.86..61.98 rows=850 width=68)
                           Sort Key: job_positions.u_name, job_positions.id DESC
                           ->  Seq Scan on job_positions  (cost=0.00..18.50 rows=850 width=68)
(10 rows)
```

You see that the cost of query with join is less than the cost of query with subquery.
