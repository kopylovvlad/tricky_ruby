# Joins and subqueries

Subqueries are notoriously tricky to implement in relational databases. This is unfortunate, as they’re often very useful. In particular, it’s often much easier to construct queries of this form programmatically than it is to explicitly construct a join programmatically.

Remember, databases like joins a lot. Not just because they’ve been optimized very aggressively, but the symmetry of joins gives the query optimizer a lot of freedom to pick the best possible way to execute them.

The subquery form of the query only really implies one implementation: run the subquery for each row.

## Example

We have two tables users and regions. Let's write join and subquery.

```sql
SELECT u_name, u_region_id FROM users;

  u_name | u_region_id
---------+--------------
  Bilal  |           1
  Irfan  |           2
  Jordan |           3
  Justin |           1
  Paul   |           3


SELECT r_id, r_name FROM regions;

  r_id |   r_name
-------+--------------
     1 | Mississauga
     2 | Toronto
     3 | New York
```

### Join

```sql
SELECT u_name, r_name FROM users JOIN regions ON u_region_id = r_id;

  u_name |   r_name
---------+--------------
  Bilal  | Mississauga
  Irfan  | Toronto
  Jordan | New York
  Justin | Mississauga
  Paul   | New York
```

### Subquery

_Warning_: It’s an error in SQL if a subquery returns more than one row.

```sql
SELECT u_name, (SELECT r_name FROM regions WHERE r_id = u_region_id) FROM users;

  u_name |   r_name
---------+--------------
  Bilal  | Mississauga
  Irfan  | Toronto
  Jordan | New York
  Justin | Mississauga
  Paul   | New York
```

Let's run explain and look at cost.

```sql
-- Explain for join
explain SELECT u_name, r_name FROM users JOIN regions ON u_region_id = r_id;

 Merge Join  (cost=176.34..303.67 rows=8064 width=64)
   Merge Cond: (users.u_region_id = regions.r_id)
   ->  Sort  (cost=88.17..91.35 rows=1270 width=36)
         Sort Key: users.u_region_id
         ->  Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..22.70 rows=1270 width=36)
   ->  Sort  (cost=88.17..91.35 rows=1270 width=36)
         Sort Key: regions.r_id
         ->  Seq Scan on regions  (cost=0.00..22.70 rows=1270 width=36)

-- Explain for subquery
explain SELECT u_name, (SELECT r_name FROM regions WHERE r_id = u_region_id) FROM users;

 Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..32883.95 rows=1270 width=64)
   SubPlan 1
     ->  Seq Scan on regions  (cost=0.00..25.88 rows=6 width=32)
           Filter: (r_id = users.u_region_id)

```

If we don't want to use a join, but in order to optimise the query with subquery, we can write a function.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION f(integer) RETURNS text
    AS 'SELECT r_name FROM regions WHERE r_id = $1;'
    LANGUAGE SQL
    IMMUTABLE
    RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT;

explain SELECT u_name, f(u_region_id) FROM users;
 Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..340.20 rows=1270 width=64)
```

## Example 2

One more example how to optimise subquery with function.

```sql
-- create a table
CREATE TABLE squares AS
    (SELECT x, x*x AS xx FROM generate_series(-1000, 1000) x);

-- add more data to aa

-- select data with join
SELECT a, xx AS aa FROM ab JOIN squares ON a = x;
  0 |   0
  1 |   1
  2 |   4
  3 |   9
  4 |  16
  5 |  25
  6 |  36
  7 |  49
  8 |  64
  9 |  81
 10 | 100

-- select data with subquery
SELECT a, (select xx from squares where x = a) FROM ab;
-- result is the same


-- look at explain
explain SELECT a, xx AS aa FROM ab JOIN squares ON a = x;
 Hash Join  (cost=54.02..124.59 rows=2550 width=8)
   Hash Cond: (ab.a = squares.x)
   ->  Seq Scan on ab  (cost=0.00..35.50 rows=2550 width=4)
   ->  Hash  (cost=29.01..29.01 rows=2001 width=8)
         ->  Seq Scan on squares  (cost=0.00..29.01 rows=2001 width=8)

explain SELECT a, (select xx from squares where x = a) FROM ab;
 Seq Scan on ab  (cost=0.00..86767.38 rows=2550 width=8)
   SubPlan 1
     ->  Seq Scan on squares  (cost=0.00..34.01 rows=1 width=4)
           Filter: (x = ab.a)


-- try to optimise it with function
CREATE FUNCTION get_square(integer) RETURNS integer
    AS 'select xx from squares where x = $1'
    LANGUAGE SQL
    IMMUTABLE
    RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT;

-- run the query and prove that the result is the same
SELECT a, get_square(a) FROM ab;

-- look at explain
explain SELECT a, get_square(a) FROM ab;
 Seq Scan on ab  (cost=0.00..673.00 rows=2550 width=8)
```
