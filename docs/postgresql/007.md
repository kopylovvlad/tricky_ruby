# Count

`COUNT(*)` - it counts the number of rows produced by the query
`COUNT(1)` - counts the number of 1 values
`COUNT(<COLUMN_NAME>)` - counts not null values from the column
`COUNT(null)` - always returns 0

In general, you should always use COUNT(*). This is because the database can often count rows by accessing an index, which is much faster than accessing a table.
